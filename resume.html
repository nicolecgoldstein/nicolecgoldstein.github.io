They now operate Learning Center's all over the US and other countries, where children can take field trips to or attend summer camp at, to learn about STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education in a fun way. I worked in their communications department, where I wrote the weekly newsletter, wrote multiple press releases, worked on external marketing materials, and designed and compiled programs and other materials to get ready for their annual conference. </p>
